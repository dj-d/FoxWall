Recently it also started to download mp4 whithout audio, and the mkv are always damaged and have noise instead of audio, when displayed as download-Option.Whithout beeing able to download with audio I don't feel like paying for this at all.Also https://www.downloadhelper.net/asites/f/standard/1 still advertises with youtube beeing downloadable while this is not the case anymore.For years this was one of the best add-ons for firefor but now live recorder is better, as long as you are able to convert webm back to mp4."

It has always worked fine on my old Windows 7 desktop but on my Windows 10 laptop, after several recent major version updates to Firefox this add-on fails to log me in to my LastPass vault, with no useful diagnostic messages. This occurs before and after I uninstall and re-install the add-on, which is the only one I am running. Forum advice seems to be to re-create my Firefox profile, which is overkill for this problem. When the add-in was logging me in, the behaviour on some sites was inconsistent and unpredictable, in terms of whether the Add-In was displayed, what options were displayed, whether the in-field options to fill were present. I assume this is a consequence of the evolution of web technologies. Given the rapidly increasing costs of LastPass then this needs to be addressed."

For example sometimes it only fills half of the needed password fields (e.g. fills username into password field and leaves username field empty).. one cannot at the moment export passwords, it simply won\\'t function and upon research I found out this issue has been well reported since at least February 2020 in their own forums, and their only response to it is that they are \"investigating\" the issue, but no solution after many months. I am not sure if they are just incompetent or actively trying to hold peoples passwords hostage so they can\\'t replace the buggy mess with a competent password manager. I give 2 stars because it used to work reasonably well for a period and the free functions are acceptable."

The developer is really quick in responding to queries/how-to/bug reports/etc (so far at the latest within 24 hours)Overall I am very happy with this add-on, the developer puts work into keeping it updated (yet the familiar minimalist interface stays mostly the same - wished more software packages did this....looking at you MS Office)  and working around youtube\\'s ever changing protocols - Sever time isn\\'t free (how part of this add-on works) - I\\'ll be donating again this year."

When YouTube put the clamps on downloading recently, it seemed like all the downloading add-ons died. I installed Easy YouTube Video Downloader Express (hereafter EYVDE). At first I thought it was like the rest. It didn't work - there was no button to press. After some discourse with the developer, he used remote access software and did some manipulation to make it work. Seems you have to be careful what order you install add-ons and disabling them and enabling one by one will tell you which one is causing the problem. Anyway, it works now and very, very well. Also, it is worth going Pro if you are into HD video. Disclaimer: If you see another comment or review by me from an earlier date, please ignore it. I am trying to find a way to expunge it, but haven't been able to do so yet."

As popular as NoScript isn the problem is when you visit a website it blocks a bunch of scripts by default without identifying \"which\" script is responsible for the web page element making it difficult to navigate the site. It is not useful to simply list blocked scripts without knowing what each is responsible for. Main issue is most users do not know which specific scripts from a list to enable, or leave disabled, in order to navigate the scripts as required. If users have to enable all scripts then that\\'s like not having NoScripts turned on. If users have to disable all (non-default) scripts then browsing is virtually impossible. What is needed is a NoScript icon over each area on visited web pages to notify users what is blocked and what isn\\'t - at least that way users can select on a need basis what to enable or leave disabled."

And sure it isn\\'t - half of essential features are not there - no proper resume download, no multi-threaded downloads, no saving anywhere on disk, no skip on existing file. And sometimes it just \"loses\" downloads from list randomly on clearing finished or resuming or other actions.The funny part is how he deleted all of the above critique of mozilla, instantly got recommended badge, and made extension for chrome, which he again claimed he will never bother with.

                "comment":"This is currently the only internal download manager/helper (Web-)extension I found, that can handle downloads from links without actual filenames. Whenever a link contains just some ID/re-direction instead of the actual filename, other extensions either fail or download files with the ID as a useless filename. DownThemAll! uses the correct filename no matter what kind of link it has to interpret. So it\\'s really useful for downloading multiple files from a page. It\\'s a pretty good alternative to the old legacy extension \\'FlashGot\\'. Great work!Here are some suggestions to improve it even more: - Add an option to set/override the download directory. - Add \"clear downloads\" buttons to the toolbar in the manager so you don\\'t have to use the context menu to clean up the download list.- Add options to automatically remove finished downloads and/or missing downloads.- Increase the number of concurrent downloads to 20. 10 can be a little low for fast internet connections. - Add manual retry button for failed/incomplete downloads and a simple option to disable automatic retries. Retry button could also be used to re-download missing downloads. - Add an option to hide the \"OneClick\" menu items.- And maybe add an option to use a selectable one-color background for the toolbar instead of that orange pattern. ;-)"

BUT i noticed every site was getting cookies deleted, then i saw \"You must enable cookies in the browser as this extension will replace the internal cookie manager.\"Well first, i didn\\'t Enable cookies, and Cookie Auto Delete didn\\'t honor MY Settings and Enabled cookies automatically, which isn\\'t the right thing to do. \"You must enable cookies in the browser\", well i never Enabled cookies in the browser, but cookie auto delete did.The wording should read \"Cookie Auto Delete WILL enable cookies in the browser automatically as this extension will replace the internal cookie manager.Second, Can and Will cookie auto delete ever honor my settings and let me Block All Cookies and just delete the cookies that i have set to Allow for Session?To me that would make cookie auto delete Perfect in my opinion. And i could probably give it only a 4 star rating for these 2 shortcomings, but i won\\'t as one issue is a Wording issue and maybe cookie auto delete should ask before Enabling cookies, but i don\\'t think it\\'s that big of a deal since it needs cookies to delete. Fixing the wording pretty much solves that issue and asking to enable cookies before doing it would go the extra mile.And the second issue, maybe can\\'t be done, i don\\'t know, But i would think that Blocking All Cookies, Honoring that Setting and just Deleting the cookies that are set to Allow for Session is possible.i hope this is possible and will be added to cookie auto delete. i would appreciate these being addressed and looking forward to a reply from the CAD Team.Thanks in advance and all you do for us browser users.Before i submitted this review, i just thought that i haven\\'t tested this Block All Cookies and cookie auto delete Deleting just the Allow for Session cookies in my Ungoogled Chromium and Brave Browsers.i probably won\\'t test this for a few days. if you know that would be great.Thanks again and sorry for the long review but i was trying to be explain and be as thorough as possible."

I try a lot of extensions, even if I know I am going to delete them, I just like to try new things. While other people are downloading blockers and proxies to try to browse the web safely this tool allows the user to know if using those other extensions is even worth it. It is worrisome, but a user can easily be redirected to a version of the site they meant to go to and would have no idea they are entering info into a \"hacked\" site. With this tool user can verify that the domain they landed on is the one they wanted because if that is NOT the case, ad blockers are not going to help! Cheers to the Devs! As one who is trying to become a Web Developer myself I feel that every, if not most, systems should give the user more transparency, like being able to \"Inspect\" a web page and see the http/XML calls. I am not saying \"show me every line of code!\" but again as a new WebDev I know how easily people are duped simply because the technology is ever changing."

The update obviously failed to delete the many unused  files in the %mozillaprofile% directory and so I was unaware.  I thank the developer for responding so quickly and clearing this matter up.  BTW, deleting the \\epub directory reduced my profile backup size by about 90%.  OLD REVIEW BELOW, WHICH NO LONGER APPLIES-----------------------------------------------------------I have been using this add-on for years. I normally backup my Firefox Profile directory and I have been wondering why it keeps growing in size at an alarming rate. I discovered today that EPubReader stores it's data, including copies of old ePub files I've read and which I no longer need INSIDE the profile folder. This is a huge problem and for this reason I REMOVED this add-on today. Yes, I know the trick of creating a link to another folder, but it's a hassle and not worth it to keep track of so many symbolic or hard links. Any add-on that uses so much space should have a setting to choose the location of its data files."

If you want to import proxy select templates, you need to disable syncing, because otherwise all imported templates will be erased within the next minute."

Some of us are escaping governmental censorship and don’t have the means to pay for a premium service.It’d be nice if proxy services like this one, and protection services like antiviruses, remembered this. Not everyone who doesn’t pay for premium/donate is a cheap douchebag who doesn’t appreciate a service."

Not only it doesn't provide a proxy list to choose from, but it doesn't even allow you to import, if you have managed to snug one from somewhere, unless you.. pay?? Really? Who would do this and for what sake?! If one would have to pay at all, rather go for a 'vpn' add-on that's so much easier to use, especially on mobile device."
