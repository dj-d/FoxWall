                <div>You do not have to pay. You can get proxy servers from many free sources, but since they are free,
                    they are not very reliable and they are generally very slow. I do not provide free proxy lists
                    because they change all the time and their quality is poor.<br /><br />You can buy proxy servers
                    from many places, not just me, and use them with the FoxyProxy add-on. At the moment, import works
                    with FoxyProxy servers and previous versions of FoxyProxy, but I am working with other proxy vendors
                    to get them added to an import list. However, it requires their cooperation to get it right. Not all
                    vendors respond to me.<br /><br />Regarding VPN: all firefox add-ons that are called "VPN" use proxy
                    servers behind the scenes. It is just a marketing choice to call it VPN instead of
                    proxy.<br /><br />Good luck!</div>
